		 <h1>My goal is to help people understand the common misconceptions of the vaccine. I would also like to educate the elderly on how it could help improve their daily lives.  </h1>
		 <h2>Weather that be looking at the benefits of the vaccine in their social life or the benefits in their personal lives. While also debunking some major myths about the vaccine. </h2>

			<p> How safe is the <strong>vaccine</strong>? Is what you're probabaly thinking. Not to worry <br> 
			I'll be here to tell you some cold hard facts. </p>
				<ol> 
						<li>All together the united sates have distributed almost 500 million doses. with 350 million of them being adiministered. source <a href="url">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html</a> </li>
						<li>how many people have died from covid, after being fully5vacinted form covid19. The answer is <strong>.001%, thats one person for every 100 thousend. although very unlikley those are called break through cases</strong></li>
						<li>Now lets talk about the infamous "chip". we've talked about the amount of doses given( 350 million doses, two per person that would be 175 million fully vaccinated). J&J only requires only one dose, and five percent of the US population have taken  <br> the J&J vaccine thats an additional 15 million.
							that means 55% of the population is fully vaccinated. and supposedly "chiped/tracked", but let's compare that to the amount of adults who said they have a phone. 95% percent of adult in the US have stated that they have phones thats 35 percent more than vaccinated people. it wouldnt financially make sense to 
							waste that much money to track peopl when you have a better method. </li>
